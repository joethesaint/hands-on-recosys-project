However, these systems were extremely primitive. The simple recommender did not take into consideration an individual user's pereferences. The knowledge-based recommender did take account of the user's preference for genres, timelines and duration, but the model and its recommendations still remained very generic.\n\nImagine that Alice likes the movies *The Dark Knigth, Iron Man,* and *Man of Steel*. It is pretty evident that Alice has a taste for superhero movies. However, our models from the previous chapter would not be able to capture this detail. The best it could do is suggest *action* movies (by making Alice input *action* as the preferred genre), which is a superset of superhero movies.\n\nIt is also possible that two movies have the same genre, timeline, and duration characteristics, but differ hugely in their audience. Consider *The Hangover* and *Forgetting Sarah Marshall*, for example. Both these movies were released in the first decade of the 21st century, both lasted around two hours, and both were comedies. However, the kind of audience that enjoyed these movies was very different.\n\nAn obvious fix to this problem is to ask the user for more metadata as input. For instance, if we introduced a *sub-genre* input, the user would be able to input values such as *superhero*, *black comedy*, and *romantic comedy*, and obtain more appropriate results, but this solution suffers heavily from the perspective of usability.\n\nThe first problem is that we do not possess data on *sub-genres*. Secondly, even if we did, our users are extremely unlikely to possess knowledge of their favorite movies' metadata. Finally, even if they did, they would certainly not have the patience to input it into a long form. Instead, what they would be willing to do is tell you the movies they like/dislike and expect recommendations that match their tastes.\n\nAs we discussed in the first chapter, this is exactly what sites like Netflix do. When you sign up on Netflix for the first time, it doesn't have any information about your tastes for it to build a profile, leverage the power of its community, and give you recommendations with (a concept we'll explore in later chapters). Instead, what it does is ask you for a few movies you like and show you results that are most similar to those movies.\n\nIn this notebook, we are going to build two types of content-based recommender:\n\n* **Plot description-based recommender:** This model compares the descriptions and taglines of different movies, and provides recommendations that have the most similar plot descriptions.\n\n* **Metadata-based recommender:** This model takes a host of features, such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew, into consideration and provides recommendations that are most similar with respect to the aforementioned features.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Exporting the clean DataFrame\nIn the previous chapter, we performed a series of data wrangling and cleaning processes on our metadata in order to convert it into a form that was more usable.

form.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Document vectors\nEssentially, the models we are building compute the pairwise similarity between bodies of text. But how do we numerically quantify the similarity between two bodies of text?\n\nTo put it another way, consider three movies: A, B, and C. How can we mathematically prove that the plot of A is more similar to the plot of B than to that of C (or vice versa)?\n\nThe first step toward answering these questions is to represent the bodies of text (henceforth referred to as documents) as mathematical quantities. This is done as a representing these documents as vectors. In other words, every documents is depicted as a series of *n* numbers, where each number represents a dimension and *n* is the size of the vocabulary of all the documents put together.\n\nBut what are the values of these vectors? The answer to that question depends on the *vectorizer* we are using to convert our documents into vectors. The two most popular vectorizers are CountVectorizer and TF-IDFVectorizer. There are many other types. This [medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/hacking-scikit-learns-vectorizers-9ef26a7170af) post talks about them in-depth.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### CountVectorizer\nCountVectorizer is the simplest type of vectorizer and is best explained with the help of an example. Imagine that we have three documents, A, B, and C, which are as follows:\n* **A:** The sun is a star.\n* **B:** My love is like a red, red rose.\n* **C:** Mary had a little lamb\n\nWe now have to convert these documents into their vector forms using CountVectorizer. The first step is to compute the size of the vocabulary. The vocebulary is the number of unique words present across all documents. Therefore, the vocabulary for this set of three documents is as follows: the, sun, is, a, star, my, love, like, red, rose, mary, had, little, lamb. Consequently, the size of the vocabulary is 14.\n\nIt is common practice to not include extremely common words such as a, the, is, had, my, and so on (also known as stop words) in the vocabulary. Therefore, eliminating the stop words, our vocabulary, *V*, is as follows:\n\nV: like, little, lamb, love, mary, red, rose, sun, star\n\nThe size of our vocabulary is now nine. Therefore, our documents will be represented as nine-dimensional vectors, and each dimension here will represent the number of times a particular word occurs in a document. In other words, the first dimension will represent the number of times like occurs, the second will represent the number of times little occurs, and so on.\n\nTherefore, using the CountVectorizer approach, A, B, and C will now be represented as follows:\n\n* **A:** (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1)\n* **B:** (1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0)\n* **C:** (0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0)\n\n#### TF-IDFVectorizer\nNot all words in a document carry equal weight. We already observed this when we eliminated the stop words from our vocabulary altogether. But the words that were in the vocabulary were all given equal weighting.\n\nBut should this always be the case?\n\nFor example, considers a corpus of documents on dogs. Now, it is obvious that all these documents will frequently contain the word dog. Therefore, the appearance of the word dog isn't as important as another word that only appears in a few documents.\n\n**TF-IDFVectorizer (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** takes the aforementioned point into consideration and assigns weights to each word according to the following formula. For every word *i* in document *j*, the following applies:\n\n\nIn this formula, the following is true:\n* w, is the weight of word *i* in document *j*\n* df, is the number of documents that contain the term *i*\n* N is the total number of documents\n\nWe won't go too much into the formula and the associated calculations. Just keep in mind that the weight of a word in a document is greater if it occurs more frequently in that document and is present in fewer documents. The weight *w* takes values between 0 and 1:\n\nWe will be using TF-IDFVectorizer because some words (pictured in the preceding word\ncloud) occur much more frequently in plot descriptions than others. It is therefore a good\nidea to assign weights to each word in a document according to the TF-IDF formula. Another reason to use TF-IDF is that it speeds up the calculation of the cosine similarity\nscore between a pair of documents. We will discuss this point in greater detail when we\nimplement this in code.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### The cosine similarity score\nWe will discuss similarity scores in detail in `Chapter 5`, *Getting Started with Data Mining Techniques*. Presently, we will make use of the *cosine similarity* metric to build our models. The cosine score is extremely robust and easy to calculate (especially when used in conjunction with TF-IDFVectorizer).\n\nThe cosine similarity score between two documents, *x* and *y*, is as follows:\n\n\nThe cosine score can take any value between -1 and 1. The higher the cosine score, the more similar the documents are to each other. We now have a good theoretical base to proceed to build the content-based recommenders using Python.\n\n### Plot description-based recommender\nOur plot description-based recommender will take in a movie title as an argument and output a list of movies that are most similar based on their plots. These are the steps we are going to perform in building this model:\n\n1. Obtain the data required to build the model\n2.
